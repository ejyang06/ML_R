## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
rm(list = ls())
#devtools::session_info()
#install/load packages
packages_lib<- c("dplyr", "data.table", "ggplot2","reshape2","readr","caret","sqldf","readxl", "tidyquant","wordcloud","rmarkdown", "knitr",                 "devtools","readxl")
packages_ML<- c("e1071", "neuralnet", "C5.O", "cvAUC", "lime","h2o")

install.packages(packages_lib)
install.packages(packages_ML)

# Load packages
lapply(packages_lib, require, character.only = TRUE)
lapply(packages_ML, require, character.only = TRUE)

# Github pakcages
library(devtools)
install_github("h2oai/h2o-3/h2o-r/ensemble/h2oEnsemble-package")
```
